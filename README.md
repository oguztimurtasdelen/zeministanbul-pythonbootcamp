This project is a demonstration for fantasy Marvel Civil War. You can build-up two teams with your superheros and let them fight. 
You have to give an input for name, race, homeland, weapon, skill and team for each superhero. Each superhero has their own damage point which is called as "power" that is given by the system randomly between 1-100.

After you build-up the teams, the Civil War starts and each superhero hits other superhero from opposite team randomly. And total damage points is calculated for both teams regarding the superheros' power.

At the end of the battle, the highest damage point team is the winner.
