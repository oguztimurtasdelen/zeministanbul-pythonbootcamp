    v_rulesText = "There will be two separate teams in this battle, Team 1 and Team 2, and the teams will fight each other. First, you will choose how many superheroes you want on each team. Next, we'll ask you to create your own superhero combos. You will determine the name, race, homeland, weapon, skill and which team you want your superhero to be. The power of the superhero you create will be randomly determined by the system as a number between 1-100. When you create all the superheroes, the war will start and each team will gain damage points according to the power values of the superheroes. The team with the highest damage points wins the battle. Remember, each team must have an equal number of superheroes!"
